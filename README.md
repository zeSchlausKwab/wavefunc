## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS, Vite, Tanstack Router
- **Backend**: Bun
- **Nostr**: NDK (Nostr Development Kit), NIP-07, NIP-46
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (for caching/indexing Nostr events - optional, primarily relies on Nostr relays)
- **Deployment**: Nginx, Railway
- **Music Recognition**: AudD API via DVM (Nostr Data Verification Method)
- **Specification**: Follows NostrRadio event kinds and formats (see `SPEC.md`)

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) v1.x or higher
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18.x or higher
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zeSchlausKwab/wavefunc.git
cd wavefunc
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and fill in the required values (see Environment Variables section).

4. Start the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

This will start all services:

- Web app: http://localhost:8080
- Backend API: http://localhost:3001
- Relay: ws://localhost:3002

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required:

```
VITE_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=development
PUBLIC_HOST=localhost
PUBLIC_RELAY_PORT=3002
PUBLIC_WEB_PORT=8080
PUBLIC_API_PORT=3001
PUBLIC_BLOSSOM_URL=<url>
# Add your Nostr pubkey if you are running a DVM or want to publish curated lists
# NOSTR_PUBLIC_KEY=<your_nostr_pubkey_hex>
# NOSTR_PRIVATE_KEY=<your_nostr_private_key_hex> # Keep this safe!
```

> **Important:** When testing features like NIP-46 login or using the app from other devices on your network, set `PUBLIC_HOST` to your machine's local IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.x`) instead of `localhost`. This ensures proper communication between devices on your network. The `NOSTR_PUBLIC_KEY` and `NOSTR_PRIVATE_KEY` are primarily for application-level event publishing (e.g. featured lists, NIP-89 handler events if the app itself publishes these). User-specific actions are signed by the user's client.

For production, you'll also need:

```
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<your-password>
POSTGRES_DB=nostr
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
```
